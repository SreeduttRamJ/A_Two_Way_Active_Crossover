# A_Two_Way_Active_Crossover

This repository contains a mini-project dedicated to designing and building a 2-way active crossover for audio systems. Active crossovers are essential components in audio signal processing, used to split an audio signal into different frequency bands, allowing for precise control and optimization of audio output.

The repository contains the following files:

- `LT_SPICE_SIMULATION/`: This directory contains the LTspice project file.
- `Document/`: Contains the Final project report done by our team.

> `Note :` If you do not have the [741 op-amp model](https://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/lm741.pdf) files installed in LTspice for simulation purposes check [how to add 741 op amp model to LT Spice ](https://forum.allaboutcircuits.com/threads/how-to-add-op-amp-741-to-lt-spice.139069/)
