# A_Two_Way_Active_Crossover

This repository contains a mini-project dedicated to designing and building a 2-way active crossover for audio systems. Active crossovers are essential components in audio signal processing, used to split an audio signal into different frequency bands, allowing for precise control and optimization of audio output.
